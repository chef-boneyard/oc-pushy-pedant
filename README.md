Overview
========

This is the oc-pushy-pedant repository; it is built on top of the chef-pedant repositories (core for OSC and OPC) to leverage the default accounts and so forth set up there.

Building
========

This repository currently requires a .deb build from the pushy branch of opscode-omnibus; it also requires that zeromq (version 2, not 3) be built before it's loaded.  This should only be a temporary requirement until the zeromq lib is added to opscode-omnibus.

1. Using the pushy .deb, build the OPC dev VM with 'rake start'.

2. Grab the v2 POSIX tarball from the [ZeroMQ site](http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software).  *No, seriously, download v2, not v3.*  For example, if it's 2.2, you can wget this:

        wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz

3. In your VM, build zeromq.  Building it easy (after scp'ing it to the /tmp dir or wherever is convenient on the dev-vm):

        tar xvzf zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
        cd zeromq-2.2.0
        ./configure
        make
        make install

4. Install the pushy server deb. It's easiest to grab a copy from jenkins.

        Browse to
        http://ci.opscode.us/job/opscode-push-jobs-server-build/build_os=ubuntu-10-04,machine_architecture=x64,role=opc-builder/
        to discover the latest version of the deb, then grab it and
        install it.

        wget http://ci.opscode.us/job/opscode-push-jobs-server-build/build_os=ubuntu-10-04,machine_architecture=x64,role=opc-builder/opscode-push-jobs-server_0.0.1-37-g40fc888-1.ubuntu.10.04_amd64.deb

        sudo dpkg -i opscode-push-jobs-server_0.0.1-37-g40fc888-1.ubuntu.10.04_amd64.deb

5. Load pushy server

        rake project:load[opscode-pushy-server]

6. Locally, clone the test repos (from above opscode-dev-vm):

        git clone git@github.com:opscode/oc-pushy-pedant.git
        git clone git@github.com:opscode/opscode-pushy-client.git

7. Load pushy pedant (make sure you have the oc-pushy-pedant, oc-pushy-pedant-tests, chef-pedant-core, oc-chef-pedant-core and opscode-pushy-client repos checked out!!1!1!)

        rake project:load[oc-pushy-pedant]

8. [OPTIONAL] Increase the heartbeat interval so the tests go faster

        vim /etc/opscode/private-chef.rb
        Add the line opscode_pushy['heartbeat_interval'] = 200
        private-chef-ctl reconfigure

9. In the VM, run the tests:

        cd /srv/piab/mounts/oc-pushy-pedant
        ./oc-pushy-pedant -c multitenant_config.rb
