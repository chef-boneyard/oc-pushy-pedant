Overview
========

This is the oc-pushy-pedant repository; it is built on top of the
chef-pedant repositories (core for OSC and OPC) to leverage the
default accounts and so forth set up there.

Building
========

1. Start a chef-server with `vagrant up` in the `dev/` folder of
   chef-server.

1. Log into your dev-vm: `vagrant ssh`

1. Using the pushy .deb you wish to test, install pushy:

        dpkg -i /path/to/package
        opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure
        chef-server-ctl reconfigure

1. Clone oc-pushy-pedant inside your dev-vm

        git clone git@github.com:opscode/oc-pushy-pedant.git

1. [OPTIONAL] Increase the heartbeat interval so the tests go faster

        vim /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
        # Add the line opscode_pushy['heartbeat_interval'] = 200
        chef-server-ctl reconfigure

1. In the VM, run the tests:

        export LD_LIBRARY_LOAD=/opt/opscode-push-jobs-server/embedded/lib
        bundle install
        ./oc-pushy-pedant -c /etc/opscode-push-jobs-server/pedant_config.rb
